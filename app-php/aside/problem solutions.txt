problem:
mysql -u root -p password -h mysql -P 3307
can't connect on the host machine
ACCESS DENIED or another ERROR
solution:
1 raise server with rebuild removing mysql folder
2 use -h localhost or -h 127.0.0.1
3 use big -P for port (not -p)

problem:
new PDO fails with correct credentials, port and host
solution:
'dsn' => 'mysql:host=mysql;port=3306;...' # host=mysql according to db service's name
